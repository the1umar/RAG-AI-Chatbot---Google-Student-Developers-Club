# RAG-AI-Chatbot---Google-Student-Developers-Club
## Overview
This workshop aimed to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI chatbot. RAG chatbots improve interaction by retrieving information and generating responses based on that retrieval, making the chatbot more knowledgeable and context-aware.

## Technology Stack
- Python
- Hugging Face Transformers
- LangChain
- Chroma (for vector storage)
- Streamlit (for deployment)

## Day-by-Day Breakdown

### Day 1: Introduction and Setup
- Introduction to RAG principles.
- Environment setup and dependency installation.
- Overview of language models and retrieval systems.

### Day 2: Enhancing Chatbot Knowledge
- Techniques for loading and preprocessing documents.
- Implementation of vector stores for efficient retrieval.
- Usage of embeddings for converting text into vectors.

### Day 3: Deployment and Testing
- Integration of the RAG chatbot into Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.
- Interactive testing and iterative feedback sessions.
